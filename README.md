## Inspiration
What gives us freedom? money. Why HR are needed for a company? hiring the best talent. Which are the best use of internet that everyone can agree that it is true need? may be , it is applying for a job. In developing and under developed country internet basically used for applying job or posting job as far as I know. And this the era of AI. So why HR need to write job manually keeping a grammar book to avoid a mistake in job post? Why the job seeker should write CV wasting their valuable time? In the countries where startup eco-system is not stablished , seeking talent is difficult for entrepreneur. Can we connect them ? 
All the problem mentioned above is one solution. That is AI integrated job portal .

## What it does
I built an AI integrated job portal "Professional Network" that connect job seeker, employer and entrepreneur. You can sign in through one of the role mentioned above. If you are register as employer then you can create job with the help of AI giving minimal information. Then see who are applied and their CV. If you are a job seeker then you can create CV and apply for job. If you are an entrepreneur then you you will have all the opportunity like employer and get extra opportunity of raising investment.
